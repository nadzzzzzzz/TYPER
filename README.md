# Typer (PowerShell)

This PowerShell script emulates keyboard input to type text from a file. It's designed for situations where pasting is restricted, effectively acting as a "typer" that reads text from a file and simulates keyboard input.

## Features

* Reads text from an `input.txt` file.
* Simulates keyboard input, character by character.
* Useful for situations where copy-pasting is disabled or restricted.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository (or download the script directly):

    ```powershell
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```powershell
    cd typer
    ```

## Usage

1.  Create a file named `input.txt` in the same directory as `type.ps1`.
2.  Paste the text you want to type into `input.txt`.
3.  Run the `type.ps1` script:

    ```powershell
    .\type.ps1
    ```

**Important:** Ensure that the application where you want the text to be typed is active and has focus *before* running the script.  The script will start typing immediately. It's highly recommended to test with a text editor first.

## Example `input.txt`

This is an example of text that will be typed.
You can put any text you want here, including special characters.

Key changes for PowerShell:

File extension is .ps1
Running the script uses .\type.ps1
No need for a virtual environment or pip since PowerShell handles dependencies differently. If your script does have dependencies (rare for this type of script), you'd handle those within PowerShell itself (e.g., using Install-Module).
The rest of the structure and explanations are generally the same, but now tailored to the PowerShell context.
