# Typer

This Python script emulates keyboard input to type text from a file. It's designed for situations where pasting is restricted, effectively acting as a "typer" that reads text from a file and simulates keyboard input.

## Features

* Reads text from an `input.txt` file.
* Simulates keyboard input, character by character.
* Useful for situations where copy-pasting is disabled or restricted.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd typer
    ```

3.  (Optional but Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
    .venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
    ```

4. Install the required library:
    ```bash
    pip install pyautogui
    ```
## Usage

1.  Create a file named `input.txt` in the same directory as `type.py`.
2.  Paste the text you want to type into `input.txt`.
3.  Run the `type.py` script:

    ```bash
    python type.py
    ```

**Important:** Ensure that the application where you want the text to be typed is active and has focus *before* running the script.  The script will start typing immediately.  It's recommended to test with a text editor first.
